Things like `:GetConfigurables()` are `:ListConfigurables()` instead. Things like `partObject.ConfigName` (setting/getting) are `:SetConfigurable` and `:GetConfigurable` respectively. Additionally, unlike part objects methods that involve the component's information can **never** be called if the component was deleted, with the **sole** exception being `:GetObject()` which returns `nil` when the component is deleted. Trying to call methods on a deleted component will produce warnings and return empty or nil data depending on the method. Components additionally do not utilize GUIDs in any way. Additionally, some events are always valid.",

For example, `Radar Gold Copper` will find the nearest Gold or Copper deposit.\n\nPutting `AllExcept` will make the seeker target everything except the given list, basically inverting it.
